# **MiniProject2**

# Statistical Calculator

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cen24/miniproject2.svg?branch=master)

Created a python module to perform statistical calculations. For each calculation we created at least one test to check for the correct value and another test to check for invalid input. Invalid input would throw an exception with a description of the problem.

See below for calculations that can be performed.

### **Program calculates the following:**
- [X] Population Mean
- [X] Median
- [X] Mode
- [X] Population Standard Deviation
- [X] Variance of population proportion
- [x] Z-Score/Standardized Score
- [X] Population Correlation Coefficient
- [X] Confidence Interval
- [x] Population Variance
- [x] Sample Variance
- [x] P Value
- [X] Proportion
- [x] Sample Mean
- [X] Sample Standard Deviation
- [X] Variance of sample proportion


this is just an introductio, project is under building will be updated soon
